            <h2>Why London?</h2>
            <h3>The City of London, widely referred to as The City</h3>
            <p>
              The Roman legions established a settlement known as "Londinium" on
              the current site of the City of London around AD 43. Its bridge
              over the River Thames turned the city into a road nexus and major
              port, serving as a major commercial centre in Roman Britain until
              its abandonment during the 5th century.
            </p>
            <p>
              The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City
              of London today, though the City extends further west than
              Londinium's Ludgate, and the Thames was undredged and thus wider
              than it is today, with Londinium's shoreline slightly north of the
              city's present shoreline. The Romans built a bridge across the
              river, as early as AD 50, near to today's London Bridge.
